# LT6502b
Second, slimmer, revision of my 6502 laptop.
I hope to address some of the things that I couldn't with the first version.

These include
* Start the design with the keybed, it's a bit squeezed in (I'm not happy with the placement of a few keys).
* Use an FFC for the display (this would make the display portion about 10mm thinner straight away!)
* Reduce the smaller fiddly bits in the case, a lot of the problems I had were down to me trying to print things with 0.1mm resolution.
* Add more clips for the case so it doesn't gape in places
* Battery level indicator
* merge the charge and console USB connector (one less cable when working on it)

This is very much a work in progress.
